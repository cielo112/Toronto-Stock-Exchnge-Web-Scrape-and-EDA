# Toronto-Stock-Exchnge-Web-Scrape-and-EDA
This folder contains 4 files, the python script used to scrape the data, the data collected and stored as csv, the exploratory data analysis report, and this readme file.

The python script was built from scratch and utilized python libraries such as 'request' and 'BeautifulSoup' to facilitate in web scrapping. Using both libraries, the highest value, lowest value, closing value and volume of stock were scraped from eodata website.The data gathered were then stored as a csv file located in the folder. The conversion and organization of the data was done thru the Pandas library.

A brief exploratory data analysis was also conducted to analyze company stock performance of the companies in the Toronto Stock Exchange with company name/code starting with letter A.
